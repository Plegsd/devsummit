# Google Event Community Guidelines & Anti-Harassment Policy

Google is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Google takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.

Please review the <a href="https://developers.google.com/community-guidelines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy</a> for full details.

We empower and encourage you to report any behavior that makes you or others feel uncomfortable during Chrome Dev Summit by emailing [chrome-dev-summit-community@google.com](mailto:chrome-dev-summit-community@google.com).
