Even though the event will occur online, we want to ensure that any interactions with Googlers and others from the community follows our code of conduct. We encourage everyone to review our [Community Guidelines](/devsummit/community-guidelines/) to ensure that Chrome Dev Summit 2020 is a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone. At Chrome Dev Summit, we take our Community Guidelines seriously, and the audience, speakers, and all involved with the event are required to agree to these guidelines. If you have any questions, please contact [chrome-dev-summit-community@google.com](mailto:chrome-dev-summit-community@google.com).
