An opportunity to hear directly from Chrome leadership, product & engineering teams about the latest innovations and updates through technical sessions, office hours, workshops and more.

**Sessions:** Over the two days, we’ll bring a single track of byte sized sessions across multiple topics while being available online to answer your questions through YouTube live chat. Day 1 sessions will focus on building strong foundations for the modern web while Day 2 sessions will show how you can focus on building incredible experiences on top of the solid foundations.

**Live Chat Q&A:** While we can’t replicate the experience of bumping into your favourite Google experts to ask them your burning questions or to just have a chat, we’ll ensure that they are on stand by via live chat on YouTube until the sessions last.

**Workshops:** Conducted by experts from the community (non-Googlers), these workshops will bring exclusive content to a limited number of developers. The limit is purely due to technical constraints in order to make the workshops interactive. Workshops will be focused on beginner-intermediate level, on topics ranging from PWA to CSS. Look out for updates on our event site and <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2020/registrations/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request an invite</a> if you’re interested!

**Office Hours:** We’ll also have representatives from various teams joining us to meet with you in a 1:1 setting and discuss challenges and opportunities for your web experience. Due to limited capacity, we encourage everyone to <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2020/registrations/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request their invite</a> for this opportunity well in advance.

**And more:** In these ever changing times, we’re working hard to bring as much flavour of past events as possible. We’ll be sharing more on what’s in store on [this website](/devsummit/) and through our <a href="https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social channels</a> so look out for more updates as we finalize more fun activities for Chrome Dev Summit 2020!
