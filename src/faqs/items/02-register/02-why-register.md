title: If the event is online and available to all, why do I need to request an invite or register?
---

While all sessions, live Q&A and other learning experiences such as Codelabs, etc (more details to follow) will be accessible to all on our event website, we have a few programs such as Workshops & Office Hours that have limited capacity. To ensure we’re able to allocate the available slots to those who are interested we’re encouraging the community to <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2020/registrations/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request their invite</a> beforehand. If you’re selected, we’ll get in touch for next steps.
